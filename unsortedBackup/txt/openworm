Wow, i was thinking one can not do such things with less Neurons than caenorhabditis elegans [1,2]. But i seem to be wrong ... this Study also talks about that the worm has also one neuron for the forward gear / forward command neuron.

Project is in my opinion of pedagogical worth because it demystifies neuronal networks.

Q: do you prefer Daniel Dennets theory OR David Calmers theory ???
