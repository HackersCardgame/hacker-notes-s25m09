Purpose Glucocorticoid (GC)-induced hyperglycemia is a frequent issue, however there are no specific guidelines for this diabetes subtype. Although treat-to-target insulin is recommended in general to correct hyperglycemia, it remains unclear which treatment strategy has a positive effect on outcomes. We performed a systematic review and meta-analy...

Background: Hyponatremia is common in hospitalized patients and its differential diagnosis and management challenging. An important mechanism is suppressed or adequately or inadequately secreted plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP). Therefore, plasma vasopressin levels may help in the differential diagnosis and in therapy management. Copeptin is secre...

Background: Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disturbance in hospitalized patients and associated with a substantial morbidity and mortality. Symptoms of severe hyponatremia vary among patients between nonspecific symptoms such as nausea or malaise or acute life threatening brain oedema. Prospective studies to assess symptoms and mortalit...

Background: An intervention trial found a trend for shorter length of stay (LOS) in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) when the CURB65 score was combined with the prognostic biomarker proadrenomedullin (ProADM) (CURB65-A). However, the efficacy and safety of CURB65-A in real life situations remains unclear. Methods: From September,...

Acute stroke has a high morbidity and mortality. We evaluated the predictive value of adrenal function testing in acute ischemic stroke. In a cohort of 231 acute ischemic stroke patients, we measured dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA-Sulfate (DHEAS), cortisol at baseline and 30 minutes after stimulation with 1 ug ACTH. Delta cortisol, the amount...

Concerns about inadequate performance and complexity limit routine use of clinical risk scores in lower respiratory tract infections. Our aim was to study feasibility and effects of adding the biomarker proadrenomedullin (proADM) to the confusion, urea >7 mmol·L−1, respiratory rate ≥30 breaths·min−1, blood pressure <90 mmHg (systolic) or ≤60 mmHg (...

Measurement of prohormones representing different pathophysiological pathways could enhance risk stratification in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and other lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI). We assessed clinical parameters and five biomarkers, the precursor levels of adrenomedullin (ADM), endothelin-1 (ET1), atrial-natriur...

Despite recommendations for outpatient management, low risk patients with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are often hospitalized. This survey analyzed perceptions of physicians, nurses, patients and relatives about feasibility of outpatient management and required duration of hospital stay. We performed a prospective, observational quest...

Abstract Background: Lower respiratory tract infections like acute bronchitis, exacerbated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and community-acquired pneumonia are often unnecessarily treated with antibiotics, mainly because of physicians' difficulties to distinguish viral from bacterial cause and to estimate disease-severity. The goal of this tr...

A close link between mood, low-grade inflammation and obesity has been demonstrated even in healthy subjects. We investigated the relationship between changes in physical and psychological symptoms and inflammatory markers during the menstrual cycle both in normal weight and in overweight women. Eight healthy normal weight (body mass index 21.6 +/-...

Inflammatory markers and insulin resistance are independent cardiovascular risk factors and are thought to be influenced by sex steroids. We investigated changes of inflammatory markers and estimates of insulin resistance during the menstrual cycle, their variances, and their relationship to each other, sex steroids, and regional body fat distribut...
